# Morgan's Ernie's Modern UI
**Compatibility:** FoundryVTT 10.286 (and maybe higher)

**Languages:** English, Español, 正體中文

A clean and theme-able visual update for Foundry VTT. This is a fork of the original [Ernie's Modern Layout](https://github.com/ernieayala/ernies-modern-layout). This is an unofficial fork to get this working on v11. I have not had any contact with Ernie as of this writing.
